I’m a **Computer Engineering student** passionate about blending **design, technology, and innovation** to create digital experiences that make a real difference.

My interests include:  
- **UI/UX Design** – crafting intuitive and user-centered interfaces  
- **Scalable Web Applications** – building robust and efficient systems  
- **Emerging Technologies** – exploring new tools that push the boundaries of what’s possible

I enjoy taking ideas from **concept to execution**—whether it’s designing interfaces, developing applications, or collaborating with teams to bring projects to life.

Beyond technical expertise, I value **leadership, adaptability, and collaboration**, qualities that have shaped my academic and professional journey. I approach challenges with curiosity and persistence, believing that **continuous learning fuels innovation**.

Looking ahead, I aspire to grow into a **versatile engineer and product leader**, contributing to projects that merge **technology, creativity, and social impact**.

Notes:
- Replace `Sanchitaprajurkar` in all image URLs with your GitHub username if it differs.
- The `ghchart.rshah.org` URL includes color query params to better match a dark background; if the service ignores parameters the image will still load with defaults.
- `activity-graph` supports other dark themes (e.g., `github-dark`, `react-dark`) — change the `theme` param if you prefer another look.
